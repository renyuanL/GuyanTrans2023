1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
印度人。

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
就好像我們講英文,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
他們一聽起來就曉得你不是他們國家的人。

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
接近就可以,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
因為這只要咒語,

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
很重要的就是,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
它的意義是根本,

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
意義是內涵,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
那聲音是外向。

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
我們說內外要如一,

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
內外要相應。

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
所以外向表現出來,

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
讓它清楚,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
就可以。

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
最重要的是內在。

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
那我們曉得,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
其實,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
這個楞嚴大咒,

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
它就是佛菩薩,

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
我們自己,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
然後還有這些空行護法,

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
甚至一些鬼道的眾生,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
其實都打成一片。

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
我們如果能夠打成一片,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
就通通是沒有障礙的力量的互動。

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
若我們跟別人有區隔,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
甚至把他當敵人看待,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
那麼你就很危險。

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
你隨時也會給人家壓力,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
你更會接受別人給你的壓力。

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
世上這些壓力,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
都是我們自己生出來的。

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
不管是你給別人的壓力,

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
或者別人給你的壓力,

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
都是自己創造,

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
自己造感。

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
一定要懂這個道理。

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
那知道這個道理,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
一切為你的心,

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
為你的事。

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
我們為什麼不把它變成,

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
你的心、事,

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
跟整個法界的大能量,

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
打成一片呢?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
為什麼要抗拒?

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
為什麼要對抗?

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
這完全沒有道理。

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
所以,叫做無明。

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
你為什麼會抗拒?

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
因為你有我。

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
有我相,就有人相,

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
就有眾生相。

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
因為有我存在,

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
就有受者相。

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
希望我永遠存在。

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
那這個其實都是無明,

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
就不應該有的想法,

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
錯誤的想法,

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
顛倒的想法。

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
一定要想辦法,

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
想辦法把它拿掉。

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
這個當然很難,

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
因為我們從那一念無明開始,

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
就不斷地在堅持這個我,

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
在壯大這個我,

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
在保護這個我。

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
所以,當然不簡單,

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
想也知道不簡單,

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
但是有智慧就簡單,

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
懂真理就簡單。

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
知道實相到底是什麼,

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
你慢慢就會放棄假象,

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
因為曉得那個沒有什麼意義,

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
還是實相才真。

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
那我們的實相是什麼?

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
我們的實相是我們本來不存在,

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
這個存在是假借我們的無明跟業力

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
所幻化的,

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
所長養出來,

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
所表現出來的一個存在的現象。

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
那這個現象是不是一定要有我?

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
一切現象其實都隨時在變,

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
所以你的所謂的那個我,

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
是一個隨時在變化的一個現象,

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
現象的連續變化而已。

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
它不能說哪一個是我,

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
但是也不能否定哪一個是我,

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
只要你還有無明在,

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
你否定不了。

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
那你執著不可得,

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
否定又不可得怎麼辦?

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
唯一的辦法還是懂得實相,

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
懂得它到底是什麼,

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
那就不會被假所騙,

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
那假我們為什麼要消滅它?

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
假根本就是假的東西,

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
你為什麼要對抗它?

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
對我們來講,

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
為什麼要保護它?

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
為什麼要抓著它不放?

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
所以這個其實都沒有道理,

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
我們一定要曉得沒有道理,

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
來化解沒有道理,

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
這樣慢慢的就在道理裡面,

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
就在法界裡面,

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
就在實相裡面。

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
好,那我想,

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
我們是不是把,

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
你們這樣會看得到嗎?

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
那個字,

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
還是要把燈打開,

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
會不會太暗?

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
我不敢說我對,

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
但是我們把它統一,

115
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
不能有明顯的錯,

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
應該我們不會有明顯的錯,

117
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
那如果你念的不太一樣,

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
就很明顯的錯。

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
好,我們看著。

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
那個S下面有一點,

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
要念捲舌的S,

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
就S的幾個音,

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
一個是S左上方一撇,

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
然後念噓噓噓,

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
許小姐的許。

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
那S如果沒有什麼就念死死,

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
如果下面有一點就念噓,

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
捲舌噓噓。

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
所以這邊呢,

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
koti sni sam,

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
那個S,

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
標準的話,

133
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
就是那個要捲一下音,

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
如果我們台灣的,

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
都不太會捲音,

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
那你的koti sni sam也OK,

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
不會有太大的問題。

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
南無沙瓦不達,

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
菩提撒瑞白。

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
南無薩達南,

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
那個P是換過去的,

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
薩達南,薩達南。

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
三脈三不達,

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
koti 南。

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
那個上面,

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
E上面有一畫,

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
就是要有長音,

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
但是現在印度,

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
也不是那麼樣子的強調,

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
所以也不需要拉得太清楚,

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
koti 南。

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
那個T下面一點,

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
也是一樣,

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
T沒有一點是t,

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
T有一點是變成d,

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
有點像得得,

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
得得呢的得,

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
所以是koti 南。

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
三脈三不達,

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
三脈三不達,

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
三脈三不達,

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
三脈三不達,

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
三脈三不達,

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
三脈三不達,

165
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
三脈三不達,

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
三脈三不達,

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
三脈三不達,

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
三脈三不達,

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
三脈三不達,

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
三脈三不達,

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
三脈三不達,

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
三脈三不達,

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
三脈三不達,

174
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
三脈三不達,

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
三脈三不達,

176
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
三脈三不達,

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
三脈三不達,

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
三脈三不達,

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
三脈三不達,

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
三脈三不達,

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
跟上一個

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
三脈三不達。

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
第三個

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
三脈三不達,

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
三脈三不達,

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
三脈三不達,

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
三脈三不達,

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
三號

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
對

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
三脈三不達,

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
三脈三不達,

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
3蜗

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
3蜗

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
2蜗

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
2蜗

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
rotated

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
2蜗

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
2蜗

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
接

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
2蜗

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
2蜗

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
六蜗

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
張大一點

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
日西南

207
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
莎帕努格拉哈

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
那個一個勾下來

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
那個就三個長音

210
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
母音上面一劃

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
就是那個母音的長音

212
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
如果變成三角形

213
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
那就變成三倍的音

214
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
也就是說一個的短音再加一個長音

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
就變成那一個

216
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
那這種字一定是

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
前面那個字也有A

218
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
後面那個字前面也是A

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
而且還是長音的A

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
所以唸起來就變成

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
莎帕努格拉哈

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
莎哈斯拉

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
馬塔南

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
有跟上

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
南無巴哈馬內

226
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
這個巴哈馬內

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
巴哈在梵文裡面最常見到

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
巴哈就是梵的意思

229
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
巴哈馬內

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
南無陰德拉亞

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
拿拉煙拉亞

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
那個N下面一點

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
就是用一點點力

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
沒有一點的時候是ㄋ

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
有一點的時候

241
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
ㄋㄚ

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000

ㄋㄚ

245
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
就往裡面送

246
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
這個是比較講究的時候

247
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
其實我們就拿拉煙拉亞

248
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
也一樣

249
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
拿拉煙拉亞

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
就把氣往鼻子裡面再送一下

251
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
就是那個聲音

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000

都

287
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
重複

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
這裡

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
我再把它重複

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
念下

291
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
南堡繁華的

Achubhya

305
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
不動佛就Achubhya

306
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
所以有說阿出佛

307
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Achubhya

308
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Tathagataya

309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000

Tathagataya

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
所以這個地方是有明顯的錯

319
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
但是已經積習如是

320
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
我們就不改它

321
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
這邊後面一定是

322
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Tathagataya

323
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Samya Sampadaya

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
就少了那幾個字

326
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
歷來都這個樣子

327
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
所以我們就不加了

328
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000

Samya Sampadaya

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
所以這個地方其實很明顯就是

345
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
無方佛

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
所以就那個地方

347
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
顯然是少了

348
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
幾個字

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
這個地方也比較難念

350
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tathagataya

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,800

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,600
Ardoṣṇī-saṃ

416
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
這個就是 Ardoṣṇī-saṃ

417
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
就是無頂像

418
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,000
佛的莊嚴的無頂像

419
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ardoṣṇī-saṃ-vijrambamāni-cā

420
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,800
再一遍

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,600
Ardoṣṇī-saṃ-vijrambamāni-cā

422
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,200
vijrambamāni-cā

423
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,000
這個地方不太好念

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
vijrambamāni-cā

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,400

428
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Vajra-tundī-cā

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
這個每一段的後面

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Vajra-khanākā-prāvārocana

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
意思就是我與上

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
這些佛菩薩

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
你們一定要用你們的手印

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
用你們發的願力來扶持我

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
然後把一切都把我保護著

436
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
我的一切行為你們都要看著

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
很誠懇的向你們祈求

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
所以我們傳統的寺廟裡面

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
都一直念過去

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
念得很快

441
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
因為不懂意思

442
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
這一段你念完了

443
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
你做一個祈禱

444
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
等於是對一個恭敬

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
做一個交代

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
我這一段念完了

447
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
那你加持我

448
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
我恭敬你

449
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
你加持我

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
是這個樣子

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
所以應該要慢下來

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
然後收捨一下心

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
感恩一下

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
然後再第二會

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
這樣咒語跟實際的表現才會相應

456
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
也就是才有實質的內涵

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
很多人在那裡

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
你還在走過去

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
沒有禮貌

460
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
你剛剛打過招呼

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
要離開了

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
當然你要最後再做個致意

463
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
這樣比較有禮貌

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
所以我們刻意讓它慢下來

465
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
當然也不需要

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
刻意的太慢也不需要

467
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
有明顯要煞車的感覺就好

468
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
慢慢煞下來

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
然後念完

470
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
在心裡面感恩

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
祈禱一下

472
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
然後再換口氣

473
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
再念第二遍

474
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
所以每一會之間

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
要稍微停頓一下

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
不要馬上就接

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
吸口氣

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
然後再開始

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
這個是調整一下自己的身心

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
好

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
第二會

482
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
om rsi

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
這個是 rs

484
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
都是有點簡詞

485
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
rsi rsi

486
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
rsi

487
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
gana

488
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
prashasta

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
satata

490
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
gato

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
shnisam

492
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
這兩個音

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Hum

494
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Drum

495
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hum

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Drum

497
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hum

498
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Drum

499
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
有沒有發覺

500
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
這兩個音是很猛的音

501
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Drum是打仗的時候

502
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
因為古時候

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
最大的武器就是用泥土

504
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
用磚塊

505
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
用石頭打造出來的那個輪子

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
然後由上往下推

507
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Drum

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
就那個

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
所以遠遠的聽到那個聲音來

510
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
就要趕快躲

511
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
被壓到不得了

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
所以這個就是碾碎的意思

513
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hum

514
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
我們講過

515
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Hum就是把一切擊碎

516
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
擊碎以後再把它碾碎

517
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
所以這個就很明顯

518
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
就要把我們的業障

519
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
所有整個給把它清掉

520
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
的意思

521

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
在範圍裡面呢

701
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
E跟A它其實通

702
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
就是念快都差不多

703
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
一般反而會比較偏向E

704
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
那如果A的話會加一點點重

705
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
如果念A就sahiya

706
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
如果念A就sahiya

他們兩個重複的時候都是這種念法

729
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
前面輕後面重

730
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
就第一次輕第二次重

731
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
有點強調語氣的意思

732
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000

736
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
有點這種作用

737
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
泛音習慣念

738
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
我剛剛講錯

739
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
藏音一般都念

740
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
泛音要

741
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
啪 啪 啪

742
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
那個用踢剪舌來煞住那個聲音

743
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
那是啊的音 啪

744
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
煞是 啪 啪 啪

745
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
我覺得好像藏音

746
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
這個是他們的進步

747
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
用藏音念的時候很有威力

748
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
啪 好像比較沒有力

749
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
啪 就有了

750
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
所以那個

751
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
看你習慣怎麼樣沒有關係

752
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
啪 啪 啪 啪 啪

759
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
剛剛我們講說

760
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
e如果發a的時候

761
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
那個地方會稍微重一點點

762
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
sarva te ve bya pe

763
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
sarva gandare bya pe

766
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
就好像故意要有那個a

767
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
要把它突出一點點

768
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
sarva putta ne bya pe

769
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
tir ti ge bya pe

777
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
這個地方不太

778
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
那個氣音

779
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
tir ti ge bya pe

780
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
sarva udmata ge bya pe

781
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
這個發音比較特殊

782
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
你常常會有u音

783
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
那就

784
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
ud

785
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
本來是應該文

786
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
但是這樣不好發

787
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
它一般會發音

788
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
ud

789
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
sarva udmata ge bya pe

790
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
sarva vidya na ja cha re bya pe

791
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
sarva vidya na ja cha re bya pe

792
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
所以我們剛剛提到那個a

793
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
如果上面勾下來就兩個a

794
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
其實這個地方前面是往la ja

795
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
後面是a cha re

796
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
就是學問之王的意思

797
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
很有學問的意思

798
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
我們再念一遍

799
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
sarva vidya na ja cha re bya pe

這個地方

920
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
就念一字真言

921
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
不要念true

brum

923
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
brum

924
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
brum

925
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
這個字在咒語裡面是相當相當

926
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
扼要的一個字

927
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
brum

928
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
brum

929
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
trum

930
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
trum是碾脆

931
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
brum是整個把它包含

932
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
圓滿起來

933
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
所以我主張

934
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
這邊要用brum

935
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
不要還是硬要碾脆

936
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
當然圓滿當然要一切功德都收拾起來

937
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
所以說

938
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
brum

939
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
這就是圓滿無礙

940
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
把一切

941
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
讓這些圓滿

942
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
阻礙的通通去掉

943
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
那vum

944
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
其實一方面就是儲藏

945
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
二方面vum也是成就

946
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
vum ah vum

947
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
vum ah vum

948
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
一個是確定的

949
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
就跟金剛一樣

950
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
可以破一切無名

951
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
然後什麼東西一來都破不了它

952
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
就那個vum

953
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
vum

954
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
brum

955
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
pah

956
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
念起來它感覺會相當有

957
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
感覺有力量

958
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
那如果我們只是做做形式

959
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
念過就算了

960
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
其實那個作用

961
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
不會太大

962
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
為什麼這麼說就像鸚鵡學講話

963
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
講得太在向

964
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
你只會回頭看

965
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
是誰在說話

966
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
一看鸚鵡在說話

967
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
你會曉得他講的一點意義都沒有

968
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
鸚鵡很醜

969
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
聽到聲音

970
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
這些空心虎

971
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
聽到好像有人在叫他名字

972
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
這個我也不知道

973
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
他也不是在叫

974
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
雖然好像在叫我的名字

975
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
但是他在叫的不是我

976
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
就是這個意思

977
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
像我的名字

978
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
鸚鵡聽

979
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
鸚鵡大概是我

980
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
看過就不認識

981
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
我就曉得

982
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
好

983
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
好

984
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
我們大家

985
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
一起來念一遍

986
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
你就看哪邊好像怪怪的

987
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
對一下就可以

988
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
我們慢慢的念

989
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
念

990
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000

1053
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
抱歉

1054
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
剛剛那個

1055
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
剛剛在念阿彌陀佛那邊

1056
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
很明顯多出兩個字

1057
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
但是我們向來都這樣念

1058
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
所以還是早念

1059
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Namo Bhangavate

1060
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000

Tathagataya

1062
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
應該是這樣

1063
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
沒有道理

1064
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Namo Bhangavate

1065
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
然後又Namo Amitabhaya

1066
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
沒有道理

1067
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
所以這個很明顯

1068
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
那個地方也是錯的

1069
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
然後那個藥師佛也是錯

1070
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
因為後面沒有

1071
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
這個是

1072
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
我那時候做的時候很想把它改掉

1073
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
但後來想說還是不要改

1074
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
因為已經從宋朝一直念念到現在

1075
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
你把它改掉就怪怪的

1076
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
好,再繼續

不要

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
不要

1096
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000

1432
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000

這個咒就已經把你保護起來

1438
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Pandabandane

1439
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
就是護持護持

1440
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
照著照著我

1441
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
所以一切的障礙都禁不了你的身

1442
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
那個十小咒

1443
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
我們有時間再來念

1444
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
先把楞嚴咒

1445
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
大家都念

1446
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
念成一樣

1447
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
咱們就會很莊嚴

1448
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
其實我們熟了以後

1449
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
各唱各的調

1450
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
起來就是泛音海潮音

1451
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
你就唱你的

1452
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
只要每一個人速度一樣

1453
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
音節一樣

1454
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
各唱各的調

1455
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
起來會很棒

1456
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
現在我們當然還沒有這種功夫

1457
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
大家都會被那影響

1458
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
其實到最後

1459
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
你都要做你自己

1460
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
但是做你自己不要妨礙別人

1461
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
你唱得很大聲

1462
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
讓人家都不能唱

1463
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
那當然不行

1464
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
我們就只要好好唱我的調

1465
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
跟著大家的節奏

1466
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
這樣起來會很漂亮

1467
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
我一直在等待那一天

1468
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
等了十年都等不到

1469
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
我錄音都自己一個人搞定

1470
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
我從來不請人家錄

1471
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
因為音會不會跟我合我不曉得

1472
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
突然冒出一個不合的

1473
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
那就前功盡棄

1474
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
還是我自己合自己的音比較好

1475
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
當然你熟了以後

1476
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
你就是任運

1477
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
就很高興

1478
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
你就很投入很高興的去念它

1479
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
久而久之

1480
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
就跟佛菩薩打成一片

1481
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,000
我們現在是自覺

1482
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
就把自己擱起來

1483
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
劃立自限

1484
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
說人家怎麼都不理我們

1485
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
事實上大家都準備理你

1486
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
但是你就不理人

1487
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
人家怎麼理你

1488
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
用熱臉去貼你的冷屁股

1489
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
沒有人願意

1490
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
所以我們就隨時散放出

1491
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
這個喜悅開放的身心狀態

1492
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
不僅僅你會有很多朋友

1493
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
看不見的朋友會更多

1494
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
但是看不見通通你的朋友

1495
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
不是要害你的

1496
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
那如果活的人都是想

1497
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
你都怕他害你

1498
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
那大概這個看不見的

1499
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
也大概都不想理你

1500
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
人都不理你他還理你

1501
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
所以我們的心態真的很重要

1502
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
那個健康的心態

1503
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
我們學佛學得很自在

1504
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
到處都是順境

1505
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
那我們如果怪怪的

1506
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
到處你都是逆境

1507
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
因為沒有人要看怪人

1508
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
看一個怪怪的過來

1509
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
就不理你

1510
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
你如果主動打招呼

1511
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
就隨時心裡都放著慈悲光

1512
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
那個智慧光

1513
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
誰不歡迎你

1514
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
每一個都歡迎你

1515
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
尤其無形的

1516
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
有鬼道的、地獄道的眾生

1517
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
他們隨時在恐懼中

1518
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
他們只要看到一點點

1519
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
慈悲光、智慧光

1520
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,000
心裡就會得到加持安慰

1521
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
所以不要把自己看輕

1522
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
你雖然現在還沒有成佛

1523
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
但是你生起佛念

1524
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
心即佛、佛即心

1525
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
那時候你就是一個

1526
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
很大的能量、能源

1527
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
你隨時可以加持

1528
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,000
這些比我們福報差

1529
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
在恐懼中落日子的眾生

1530
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
所以起正念、起善念

1531
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
起慈悲念、起佛念

1532
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
很重要

1533
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
吾阿訓
